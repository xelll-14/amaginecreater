                <h3 class="title-blog">“From Confusion to Code Creation: A First-Year IT Journey”</h3>
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>As the fleeting timeline of being a first-year Information Technology student at Cebu Eastern College comes to an end, I would like to share everything I experienced during my entire school year, starting from day one. Kidding! To make it more relatable, let's first start in the pre-college era.</p>
                    <p>Back then, when I was still in high school, I didn't actually mind what course I should take when I got into college. I was confused at first about how these things worked—this was the same reason why I chose the General Academic Strand in senior high school. I didn’t think too much about it. However, I tried asking people for advice, and many of my relatives suggested taking an IT course. They shared stereotypes (though I'm not sure if they are true) about IT having a high salary and tons of opportunities, especially in foreign lands. When the time came for me to make a choice, I was torn between taking Education or Information Technology.</p>
                    <p>Regarding Education, I am capable of teaching people, but the drawback is that I don't have enough patience. I can’t imagine handling a class full of varying students; it seems like it would be chaotic. Additionally, I lack the courage to face many people almost every day. I’m also a nocturnal person, which means I am very awake at night but sleep when the sun comes up—teachers or instructors often prepare early each day.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I didn’t have any insights or knowledge in Information Technology. How would I handle practical or hands-on situations, right? However, I ultimately chose this subject area. I felt no pressure; I am someone who is competitive, who wants to take on any challenge, and someone who can adapt to any situation. So, I took the course.</p>
                    <p>At first, I was skeptical about whether I actually wanted to pursue the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology because I had no experience with computers or technology aside from editing simple PowerPoint presentations and casually using it as an everyday tool. I decided to take on this challenge; I didn’t have any easy choices anyway—either way, it would be hard.</p>
                    <p>In the opening class, I remember telling the instructor about my lack of experience in computer technology. He implied that if I had the willingness to learn, there wouldn’t be a problem. I took that to heart. I worked actively and diligently, from minor subjects to major ones. In just almost one year, I learned a lot and gained experiences and expertise, improving my technical skills and capabilities.</p>
                    <p>To be honest, I found that the major subjects were more relaxed compared to the minor classes, which put you in situations that felt like you were about to break down—either in tears, anger, or frustration. The only thing that was crucial in the major subjects was the hands-on exams. Unlike the minor subjects, where you already know what parts of the lesson to study, in major courses you really have to carve everything into your mind to prepare for exams. I even found myself in situations where, no matter what or how I studied, I couldn’t understand what I was reading.</p>
                    <p>The first time we took our hands-on computer major exam, everyone was nervous, especially the moment we stepped inside the computer laboratory where the examination took place. The nervousness and the cold breeze of the air conditioner doubled the pressure we felt. My classmates and I were quiet. While our instructor arranged us alphabetically, one seat apart from each other, everyone was studying, taking advantage of the last minute. The examination included critical thinking, and luckily, I was among the few who passed. It felt like I had just won a battle against a large number of warriors in a fantasy land. I felt very proud of myself. That moment was just the first semester; there were still many more stories to tell.</p>
                    <p>One of the most memorable experiences was when we shot a 20-minute short film for our minor subject in just a single day. We were so focused on our other subjects, especially our majors, that we forgot to give time to this project. We started on a very hot morning, specifically at Plaza Independencia. We even paid for entrance to Fort San Pedro Museum to have an old vintage background view, since the necessary genre of the film was fantasy. I wasn't an actor, but I took on the roles of director, scriptwriter, organizer, and camera operator, despite having no expertise in any of these areas. Luckily, I had one reliable member in our group who could alternate with me in our roles. Although there were passionate members in our group, it’s inevitable to have less enthusiastic members in random groupings. To make things harder, we also had to consider the visitors in the area while we filmed, which made timing difficult, resulting in many retakes and causing us to spend our whole day wrapping things up.</p>
                    <p>As night fell, we were almost done, but not perfectly done. We just hoped that everything would come together nicely now that we had finished filming. That day was full of mixed emotions—laughter, distress, frustration, and so much more. My skin darkened from the direct sunlight. Nevertheless, that highlighted the hard truth of the first chapter of my saga in just one minor subject.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the intramurals, which were supposed to be a fun moment, I can honestly say that most students, including me, were not very happy about it, mainly due to the scorching heat. We attended for grades and attendance. Still, it was both an awful and nice experience. On the plus side, we represented our department by performing a cheer and we came in third place, but it’s worth noting that there were only three competitors. At least we were awarded for being the most organized, but the other two departments also received their achievements. Additionally, all first-year college students danced together for our PE presentation. To sum it up, it wasn't a totally bad experience.</p>
                    <p>Then came D'big Calmback, an annual event at our school with the theme "candy carousel." This meant we had to dress in pastel colors to match the theme. Everyone was excited; there were lots of booths, sports, and shows going on. However, I didn’t watch or try any of those activities. We spent all day doing TikToks in our room, which was a bonding experience for our circle of friends. We only went out to take a single picture for proof that we attended each event. During this time, I realized that I was actually good at putting outfits together. From the long sky-blue sleeves to the matching shoes, I felt I could also be a fashionista sometimes. Anyway, that was then. To conclude, while the event was chaotic due to the large number of students, I still admired how everyone followed the theme and looked great in their outfits.</p>
                    <p>Another event, another day at school. Next up was IT Days, a two-day event exclusively for our department. There were countless games, including a Mobile Legends tournament, an animation contest, and Mr. and Ms. IT 2025, among others. One funny situation occurred when the Blockblast tournament was lacking players. The coordinator asked my friends and me to join, recalling our teacher mentioned that if we participated, we would earn extra points. Despite not knowing how the tournament worked, we hurriedly downloaded the Blockblast application. To make a long story short, we were eliminated in the first round. The only requirement was to survive the game for just 5 minutes, but we didn’t even have to engage; we could have just placed our phones down and waited to enter the second round. Stupid, I know. Afterward, we went to support our friends in the Mobile Legends tournament, where the competition was intense, but they unfortunately lost. Better luck next time! In the end, it was the experience that counted. That event was tiring but also a great day for us.</p>
                    <p>Now, let’s get back to the real purpose of school: learning. Our instructor introduced us to HTML and CSS in web development. It was another nervous moment. The introduction of lessons, elements, attributes, techniques, and styling for websites was overwhelming. I was confused at first, but once I learned the basics, I started getting better at creating websites. I developed my own website, <b>"A-magine & Create-R,"</b> as part of a project with my classmate, Allysa. Our website targets people who find web development interesting but lack the courage to pursue it. We aim to inspire and motivate them with our stories and experiences in computer technology, which is complex yet incredibly enjoyable. Just so you know, we managed to create this website using only basic technologies—HTML and CSS—for designing web pages. In just a month, I was able to master the basics.  <b>A-magine & Create-R</b> is the final output, and throughout the process it is stressful, but you won't believe that the majority of the experience is that I enjoyed it, the knowledge and insights that I am feeding myself from is about to finish its result. Now, this blog will be the last piece in creating our own masterpiece. I am in awe and beyond happy seeing the thing we created from scratch brought to life by its functions and colored theme. After that, we will proceed in defending this to our instructor. Wish us luck. I'll update right after.</p>

                <h3 class="title-blog">“A Glimpse into Chinese Culture: My Red Lantern Festival Experience”</h3>
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>I have never been to a Red Lantern Festival before, and the only thing I knew about it is
                        that this originated in Chinese culture, and since I am from a Chinese-Filipino school, I
                        am able to attend this mysterious event for me. The moment I stepped into the location
                        of the celebration, I did not actually expect anything, but after seeing the main stage, it
                        seems like I am in a different location. The red lanterns decoration and the color red are
                        sending autumn atmospheric vibes.
                    </p>
                    <p>The organizer of the said event is still preparing for a rehearsal of a dance with various
                        Chinese-based steps; the costumes and props are also very eye-appealing to look at,
                        not just because it is not usual in my eyes but because of how demure and beautiful it
                        is. The singer’s voice was also very impressive in chanting the lyrics and pronunciation
                        of the Chinese song; its nice voice also blended well with the song.
                    </p>
                    <p>The event started with the arrival of the traditional Chinese lion and dragon dance while
                        the host was announcing the meaning behind it. The dragon dance symbolizes
                        prosperity, power, and the ability to fend off evil spirits, while the lion dance symbolizes
                        strength, stability, and superiority. Because of this, I was able to acknowledge and
                        appreciate other cultures’ traditions and how meaningful they are. The Chinese in
                        distinct clans associated with the organization also arrived after that.
                    </p>
                    <p>The rest of the events consist of the rehearsed traditional dance, where I was able to
                        see the full potential of the performance, providing me with a sense of awe. The
                        traditional Chinese parasol, the red lanterns, the various Chinese dance steps, and the
                        singer’s enchanting voice are integrated together, creating a masterpiece presentation.
                        It made me realize the beauty of the Chinese culture and traditions as it continuously
                        provides me with great experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of my favorite C-drama official soundtracks was also sung by a student. It really
                        brings me back to the time when I first watched the Chinese drama. But what really hits
                        me the most is the powerful voice of a boy, who sung an unfamiliar Chinese song.
                        Despite not knowing the song, I was simply in a state of awesomeness as his intense
                        voice singing a particular part of the song reached my ears.
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, the Red Lantern Festival provides me with an excellent experience. The more I
                        absorbed this Chinese-based festival, the more I appreciated and admired their cultural
                        traditions. The meaningful dragon and lion dance symbolizes good fortune and is said to
                        fend off bad spirits. The decorations, props, and warm colors are sending autumn
                        atmospheric feelings. The performances that made me feel mixed emotions, the
                        nostalgia, and mostly the awesomeness even provided me with a more significant
                        understanding of others' culture and traditions.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="title-blog">“Year One — Finding Love in Code”</h3>
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>Many students wonder: "What is the life of an IT student really like? In this blog, I'll share the genuine experiences behind the computer screens, beyond the stereotypes we often hear.
                    </p>
                    <p>I could still recall my first semester in IT, I was so eager and also I was interested in learning.
                       There was something in the computer laboratory that made it feel like an impossible world walking in.
                       “Hello World” — unimaginative, but the rush of printing your first output on the screen was unparalleled.
                    </p>
                    <p>I still remember the first time I got a program to compile with no errors. It felt like receiving superpowers!
                       Along with the excitement, naturally, came challenges. For Data Structures and Algorithms,
                       There were numerous sleepless nights spent going through code that just wouldn’t work.
                    </p>
                    <p>IT student life and all the projects that are part of the catalog.
                       I’ve gotten worn out staring at my laptop so many times, trying to find a way to fix bugs that felt like an immovable mountain.
                       These were times when I doubted if in fact IT was the right choice.
                       But when you see your system finally working, there’s a special satisfaction. That feeling is what makes me stronger
                       every time I’m about to throw in the towel. I recall our simple project for a local company - just a database system,
                       but when I saw the way it made their work more efficient, I was able to understand the pivotal importance of what we do.
                    </p>
                    <p>Being an IT student, there are various challenges. The lost hours of sleep, the frustration when the code fails,
                       and the huge amount of pressure to know all things new tech. At times, you question whether all the struggle is worthwhile.
                       But there are successes that remind you why you took this route. Just like the first website I made and no one else helped me with
                       or just helping classmates who were having trouble on their code.
                    </p>
                    <p>The life of an IT student is not a piece of cake. It is often filled with challenges, sleepless nights and self-doubt.But it’s also 
                        abundant in discovery, creativity and gratification that aren’t present in other domains. With every error message, every successful 
                        compilation, every project finished,I’ve realized bit by bit that what this journey is worth. It’s more than system building or making 
                        things work,and how to craft yourself as a digital citizen, ready to navigate to test the vast reaches of the digital world.
                    </p>
                    <p>So for those considering, or beginning their IT journey, keep this in mind: It's hard, yeah, but worth it.
                       And for some of us who are still on our way there, let's keep coding and debugging – not only our programs, but our lives, too.
                    </p>
